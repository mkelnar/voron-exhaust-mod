Modified exhaust for Voron Trident with BTT SFS V2.0 Smart Filament Sensor

---
## Description

This modification of original exhaust fan housing for [Voron Trident](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Trident) (possibly also for 2.4)
has integrated filament sensor module [SFS v2](https://github.com/bigtreetech/smart-filament-detection-module/tree/master/V2.0)
made by [Bigtreetech](https://biqu.equipment).

This smart filament sensor is mounted internally on top shell of re-designed exhaust body
with three screws which comes in package with sensor. There is prepared also hole for fan wires so all wires from exhaust filter could be
led together internally over exhaust filter grill to channel of aluminium extrusion and then down together with cables from gantry.

Wires from fan goes through hole and then over the adhesive cable clips on wall.

Together with exhaust fan housing redesign I've decided to redesign also housing mount. Instead of two independent mounts which are not easy
to screw on proper place, here are both side mounts solidly connected. For design purposes a small canopy has been added to cover edges and
spaces between filter grill, aluminium extrusion and filter housing.
